# Testing With Jasmine

Jasmine is a testing framework that includes a "test runner", an [assertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)) library, and [spies and mocks](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12827580/mocking-vs-spying-in-mocking-frameworks), as well as [asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)) methods you wish to test in your code.

# An introduction to closures

Closures are an important step to understanding [lexical scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope_vs._dynamic_scope).  This lesson intends to show students what a closure looks like, and explain it's importance from a high level (e.g. we'll use it later to create psudo-private variables) but we save the "meat" for a later lesson.

# OO-ish JS

JavaScript doesn't use traditional Object Oriented Programming (OOP) style of inheritance (although the `ES6` `class` keyword makes it look more OOP).  Instead, JavaScript uses [Prototypal Inheritence](http://javascript.info/tutorial/inheritance). 

## Prototypal inheritance

1. [call](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call) vs [apply](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply)
    * http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-apply-call-and-bind-methods-are-essential-for-javascript-professionals/
    * Biggest take away: `call` will have the same method signature (parameters), where apply will take an array and "apply" it in order as the parameters
    * both use the new `this` (aka context) as the first argument
2. prototype changes apply to all instances

### Antipatterns

Don't [extend the prototypes of the core language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain#Bad_practice_Extension_of_native_prototypes
).


## Object.create

Shorter, "improved" version of Prototypal inheritance pioneered by [Douglas Crockford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford) (Godfather of JS / JSON).

## ES6 “class” keyword

### exports keyword

This is a precursor to The Module Pattern we'll learn in lesson 4.  We need to understand how `module.exports` works, however, in order to be able to work with testing frameworks (at least with the current setup).
