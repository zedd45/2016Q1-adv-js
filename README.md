Advanced JavaScript - The Creative Circus

This course focuses on teaching students ES6 (as well as more traditional ES5) concepts in JavaScript that are valuable tools for understanding the core language.  

The class is taught using [`Jasmine`](http://jasmine.github.io/) to run assertions from a shell.  In this fashion, the course is intended to enforce [TDD](http://tddjs.com/) JS. 

The interpreter is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `v4.x.x`, but we use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/) for some examples in class.
