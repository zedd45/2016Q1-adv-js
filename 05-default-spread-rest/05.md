# Default Parameters

## Arity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity

> In logic, mathematics, and computer science, the arity Listeni/ˈærᵻti/ of a function or operation is the number of arguments or operands that the function takes.

Remember: When a method is called, [the arguments](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/156767/whats-the-difference-between-an-argument-and-a-parameter#answer-156787) are the data you pass into the method's parameters.

# Rest Parameters

http://tc39wiki.calculist.org/es6/rest-parameters/

> Rest parameters provide a cleaner way of dealing with functions that takes [sic] arbitrary number of parameters [rather] than using arguments.

> When a function with a rest parameter is called a new Array is populated with all the trailing arguments. This is always an Array (never null or undefined) even if too few arguments were passed.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters

> The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

> If the last named argument of a function is prefixed with ..., it becomes an array whose elements from 0 to theArgs.length are supplied by the actual arguments passed to the function.

> There are three main differences between rest parameters and the arguments object:
1. rest parameters are only the ones that haven't been given a separate name, while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function;
2. the arguments object is not a real array, while rest parameters are Array instances, meaning methods like sort, map, forEach or pop can be applied on it directly;
3. the arguments object has additional functionality specific to itself (like the callee property).


# Spread

https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-the-spread-operator

>Closely related to rest parameters is the spread operator. While rest parameters allow you to specify that multiple independent arguments should be combined into an array, the spread operator allows you to specify an array that should be split and have its items passed in as separate arguments to a function.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator

> The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.

> Just like with spread for argument lists `...` can be used anywhere in the array literal and it can be used multiple times.

> Sometimes however you have those arguments in a list and just don’t want to access every index just for a method call – or you just can’t because the array is formed dynamically – so you use `.apply`. This feels kind of awkward because `.apply` also takes a context for `this`, which feels out of place when it’s not relevant and you have to reiterate the host object (or use `null`).

> ```console.log.apply(console, [1, 2, 3])```


> [...] a nice perk of the spread operator is that it can be used on anything that’s an iterable. This encompasses even things like the results of `document.querySelectorAll('div')`.
