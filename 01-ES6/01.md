# Lesson 1

## preamble

The first week focuses around the tooling of writing JavaScript in the modern environment.  

Modern day workflows will make use of the console to run `node.js`.  This might be something simple like a (shell command to run babel and convert ES6 code to ES5)[https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/#babel_cli], or it could run something complicated like ['webpack'](https://webpack.github.io/).

In order to install all these advanced tools, we must have a copy of [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.  I typically recommend [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) because it allows a developer to quickly install and switch between versions of Node, so there is less opportunity for breaking an older project when you upgrade (because you can just `nvm install {oldversion}`).

We set up an [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) file to tell our editor (`> 80% sublime`) how to format new code that we enter. 

Next we install [eslint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring.html) set up `.eslintrc.js` to tell eslint what we expect our syntax to look like.  This validates everything from missing semicolons to advanced ES6 / ES2015 syntax, up through bugs caused by common typos (enforces `===`).

We discuss the `let` and `const` keywords in ES6 (which is enabled by default when we use the run time environment or [REPL](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html) of `Node v4.x.x`). 

Finally, we cover how `const` does not make arrays or objects immutable, but prevents 'primitive' types from changing (e.g. `Number`), but does prevent the [_reference_ from changing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const).
