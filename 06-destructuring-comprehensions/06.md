> The object and array literal expressions provide an easy way to create ad hoc packages of data. Once you've created these packages of data, you can use them any way you want to. You can even return them from functions.
> One particularly useful thing you can do with destructuring assignment is to read an entire structure in a single statement [...]
> This capability is similar to features present in languages such as Perl and Python.

> Without destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable [...]

> Thanks to destructuring assignment, functions can return multiple values. While it's always been possible to return an array from a function, this provides an added degree of flexibility.
> You can also retrieve the return values as an array
