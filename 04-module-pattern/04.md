# Module Pattern

The module pattern is an important design pattern for JavaScript.  This pattern is used in libraries, `npm` modules, and more.  

The pattern makes it easy to determine the "public interface" (the parts of our program that are explicitly exposed) for other parts of our program, or even other programs that utilize our code (think: `npm` modules).

# Higher-order functions

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

Higher order functions are fundamental to JavaScript: when you use `callbacks` - aka functions that passed to other functions to be called at some time during the execution cycle, you are using HOF.

> You may have heard it said that JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens. What this means is that functions in JavaScript are treated as objects. They have the type Object, they can be assigned as the value of a variable, and they can be passed and returned just like any other reference variable.
