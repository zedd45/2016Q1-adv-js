# pure vs impure functions

1. http://www.nicoespeon.com/en/2015/01/pure-functions-javascript/

> A pure function doesn’t depend on and doesn’t modify the states of variables out of its scope.

> Concretely, that means a pure function always returns the same result given same parameters. Its execution doesn’t depend on the state of the system.

> Pure functions are a pillar of functional programming.

There are many benefits to this pattern; The aspect I chose to focus on in the above is *Reproducible Results*.  Pure functions will always produce the same result given the same input, so they are easily testable.  In addition, they do not produce [side effects](https://davidwalsh.name/preventing-sideeffects-javascript) (e.g. they do not modify global variables or other state of the program that another programmer or part of the program may be relying on to be in the same state).


# Scope

> This pattern of public, private, and privileged members is possible because JavaScript has closures. What this means is that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. This is an extremely powerful property of the language.
